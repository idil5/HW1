            <h2>Films</h2>
            <h3>Favorite Movie</h3>
            <p>My all-time favorite movie is "The Dark Knight." Christopher Nolan's direction and Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker have made it a standout film in the superhero genre.</p>

            <p>These films represent a diverse range of genres and storytelling styles. From the psychological depth of The Dark Knight to the emotional significance of Interstellar, each movie offers a unique cinematic experience.</p>
            <h6>Movie Night Tradition</h6>
            <p>Almost every Tuesday, my friends, siblings and I go to the movies (they're discounted on Tuesdays) at both AMC and showcase. But I prefer AMC!.</p>

        <section id="video-games">
            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <h3>Gaming as a Hobby</h3>
            <p>Video games have been a significant part of my life, I spent a lot of time with my siblings playing videogames. I'm one of 8 siblings and a lot of the times we would split the screen 4 ways and take turns.</p>
            <h4>Storytelling in Games</h4>
            <p>One of my favorite aspects of gaming is the storytelling and my favorite game of that genre are the Spiderman games. They're so much fun!</p>
            <h5>Social Aspect of Gaming</h5>
            <p>I also appreciate the social aspect of gaming. Online multiplayer games have allowed me to make many friends and connect with family overseas. </p>
            <h6>Current Favorite Game</h6>
            <p>Right now, I'm still really into Spiderman 2. I love replaying it with my little brother, but my ultimate favorite is Call of Duty specifically Black Ops 1, 2 and 3</p>
